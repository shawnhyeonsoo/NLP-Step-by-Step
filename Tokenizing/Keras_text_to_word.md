```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import text_to_word_sequence
print(text_to_word_sequence("Don't be fooled by the dark sounding name, Mr. Jone's Orphanage is as cheery as cheery goes for a pastry shop."))
```

Result: </br>
["don't", 'be', 'fooled', 'by', 'the', 'dark', 'sounding', 'name', 'mr', "jone's", 'orphanage', 'is', 'as', 'cheery', 'as', 'cheery', 'goes', 'for', 'a', 'pastry', 'shop']</br>

> It can be seen that the Keras' text_to_word_sequence removes punctuations such as commas, but keeps the apostrophe such
  as "don't", "jone's"
